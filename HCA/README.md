# ECG Classification Project

## CSV File Handling

This project uses CSV files for ECG data storage and model performance results. However, these files are intentionally excluded from version control because:

1. They can be large in size
2. They may contain sensitive medical data
3. They can be regenerated from the code

### Working with CSV files

- To use the project, place your ECG data CSV files in the `data/` directory
- Model performance CSV files will be automatically generated in the project root
- These files are listed in `.gitignore` and won't be committed

### Regenerating CSV files

The following files can be regenerated by running:
1. `results_table.py` - Generates model performance results
2. `train_all_models.py` - Requires input CSV files in `data/` directory
